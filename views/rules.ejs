      <h1 class="center">Some games are meant to be played without rules. This is not one of them.</h1>
      <ol>
            <li>
                All the rules mentioned herein are subject to change without any prior notice at all. By signing up for
                Sudoku Champs, you agree to follow all the regulations below.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the event of any disputes, the manager's decision shall hold.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to complete a game of Sudoku, you, the participant must fill in a pre-supplied 9 X 9 grid such
                such that each row, column and regular 3 X 3 sub-grid within the original grid contains each of the
                numbers 1 through 9, but exactly once, as shown <a href="/solved" id="reg">here</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The initial provided grid will have some numbers filled in, which will guide you along the way.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game is declared to be concluded when any one of the following conditions hold true:
                <ol>
                    <li> One of the two opponents (in case of a head to head match) successfully completes an unsolved puzzle. </li>
                    <li> The player concedes the game by opting to declare. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                In case of a head to head competition between two players, the players will be provided with a computed
                score at the end of the game which depends on:
                <ol>
                    <li>The time taken to solve the grid. A higher score is awarded for lower times.</li>
                    <li>The number of unsolved cells. Fewer unsolved cells result in higher scores.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                At any given point of time, all players involved in the game will be subjected to the process of ranking
                (game category wise), with ascension priority being attributed to the following factors:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Points earned: Each victory (in case of a head to head match) earns the victor two points, a loss
                        earns the player zero points, and a tie / victory by opponent forfeit results in one point.
                    </li>
                    <li> Matches won. </li>
                    <li> Matches played. </li>
                    <li> Number of forfeits, if any.</li>
                    <li> </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
      </ol>
